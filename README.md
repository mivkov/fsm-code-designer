# Features

## Short Term

### Dfa executor
1. DFA --> executor (code execution engine)
    * input DFA -> walkthrough + execution in UI
    * generate execution script
2. Support diagram, graph, formal definition of FSM
    * allow reference of other FSM's built by user
    * allows to emulate threading

### Dfa minimizer

1. Finds a minimal DFA equivalent to the given one

### Dfa from regex

1. Use threading to skip NFA step

## Long Term

## Turing Machines

1. Support halting Turing Machines for all of the above (on all inputs)

# Implementation Details

1. C++ Backend
2. Python-Flask WebServer
3. Node.js Frontend
